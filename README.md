Weather bot 

This is a weather bot based on the API developped by "openweathermap". More information on the API here : https://openweathermap.org/current


Note: As the free version of the API only includes the forecast for the current day, the results displayed when asking for another day are the same but it can be assumed that the bot understand the notion of date.
